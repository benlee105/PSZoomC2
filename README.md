## Where's the code?
See [Releases](https://github.com/benlee105/PSZoomC2/releases).

There's PowerShell, Bash and C# versions!

## What are the pre-requisites and setup required?
You'll need a Zoom account, and create a Zoom app on Zoom's website (its super easy!).  
  
See [Workflow](https://github.com/benlee105/PSZoomC2/wiki/Workflow) for step by step instructions on setup.

## How do I use the C2?
See [Usage](https://github.com/benlee105/PSZoomC2/wiki/Usage) for step by step instructions for usage.

Commands are executed in Zoom Workplace app using the syntax:  
  
`command: <shell command>`  

## I need shellcode instead of PowerShell, Bash or C# EXE?
Download the C# version, then use https://github.com/TheWover/donut to convert to shellcode.

## I need a shellcode loader?
TBD
